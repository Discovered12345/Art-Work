# Office Culture in CSS - "Teamwork in Motion"

## What I Built
This is a playful CSS art scene titled **"Teamwork in Motion"**, illustrating a lighthearted moment from modern office life. Crafted entirely with HTML and CSS, this project features two stylized coworkers standing near a water cooler, a coffee mug, motivational sticky notes, and a potted plant — all created with semantic markup and box-based CSS art.

## Inspiration
This piece is a tribute to the little things that define office culture — spontaneous hallway chats, shared mugs, teamwork posters, and the charm of collaborative spaces. The minimal design and round-headed characters aim to evoke a welcoming and nostalgic vibe, inspired by real-life break rooms and fictional offices alike (*looking at you, Dunder Mifflin!*).

## Journey

This project was built entirely with semantic HTML and CSS, using only 358 lines of code to create a complete office scene. Every element — from the 18px-wide coffee mug handle to the 45px-tall characters — was crafted with box-model fundamentals:

```css
/* Example of CSS craftsmanship */
.head {
  width: 45px;
  height: 45px;
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #ffccbc, #d7ccc8);
  border-radius: 50%;
  /* Created facial features with ::before/::after */
}
```
