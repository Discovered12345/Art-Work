# Office Culture in CSS - "Teamwork in Motion"

## What I Built
This is a playful CSS art scene titled **"Teamwork in Motion"**, illustrating a lighthearted moment from modern office life. Crafted entirely with HTML and CSS, this project features two stylized coworkers standing near a water cooler, a coffee mug, motivational sticky notes, and a potted plant — all created with semantic markup and box-based CSS art.

## Inspiration
This piece is a tribute to the little things that define office culture — spontaneous hallway chats, shared mugs, teamwork posters, and the charm of collaborative spaces. The minimal design and round-headed characters aim to evoke a welcoming and nostalgic vibe, inspired by real-life break rooms and fictional offices alike (*looking at you, Dunder Mifflin!*).

## How I Built It
- **HTML5**: Semantic elements for structure
- **CSS3**: Box shapes, gradients, shadows, `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements
- **No JavaScript**, frameworks, or external assets — pure frontend fun!

### Features
- Layered shadow effects for depth
- Simple facial expressions using only CSS
- Sticky note with rotation and drop shadow
- Plant with stylized leaves and a geometric pot

## Challenges
The biggest challenge was positioning and layering elements (e.g., window shadows, arms, heads) while keeping the code readable and scalable. It was a great exercise in precision and visual balance.

## What's Next?
If expanded, this scene could include animation (blinking, sipping coffee), more coworkers, or even a light/dark theme toggle — all still with no JS!
